Demonstration of WorK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8Z0B600Yo&feature=youtu.be  

Try to convert this project https://github.com/hasherezade/libpeconv in Golang

run_pe.dll is compiled libpeconv  
wrappers.go is file with wrappers of dll functions  
gfuncs.go is file with same functions but without using dll  
the goal is to overwrite all functions in wrappers.go with only using golang
